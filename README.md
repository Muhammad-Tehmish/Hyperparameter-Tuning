## Hyperparameter Tuning of ML Models

This project focuses on optimizing machine learning models through hyperparameter tuning using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search. It demonstrates the importance of hyperparameters in controlling model behavior and improving performance metrics such as accuracy. The project utilizes a RandomForestClassifier as a model example, evaluating different parameter combinations to find the optimal settings.
